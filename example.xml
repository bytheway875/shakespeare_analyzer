  <SPEAKER>MALCOLM</SPEAKER>
  <LINE>We shall not spend a large expense of time</LINE>
  <LINE>Before we reckon with your several loves,</LINE>
  <LINE>And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,</LINE>
  <LINE>Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland</LINE>
  <LINE>In such an honour named. What's more to do,</LINE>
  <LINE>Which would be planted newly with the time,</LINE>
  <LINE>As calling home our exiled friends abroad</LINE>
  <LINE>That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;</LINE>
  <LINE>Producing forth the cruel ministers</LINE>
  <LINE>Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,</LINE>
  <LINE>Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands</LINE>
  <LINE>Took off her life; this, and what needful else</LINE>
  <LINE>That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,</LINE>
  <LINE>We will perform in measure, time and place:</LINE>
  <LINE>So, thanks to all at once and to each one,</LINE>
  <LINE>Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.</LINE>

<LINE>Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands</LINE>
<LINE>The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:</LINE>
<LINE>I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,</LINE>
<LINE>That speak my salutation in their minds;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:</LINE>
<LINE>Hail, King of Scotland!</LINE>
</SPEECH>
